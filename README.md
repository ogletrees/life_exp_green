# Life Expectancy and Greenness
Exploring life expectancy and greenness in the USA

Greenspace, or green vegetation, is thought to be associated with benefits to people. The CDC has released life expectancy data for small areas that can possible show us some relationships between greenness and life expectancy.

The CDC data is from:

National Center for Health Statistics. U.S. Small-Area Life Expectancy Estimates Project (USALEEP): Life Expectancy Estimates File for {Jurisdiction}, 2010-2015]. National Center for Health Statistics. 2018. Available from: https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/usaleep/usaleep.html.

> The USALEEP project produced estimates of life expectancy at birth—the average number of years a person can expect to live—for most of the census tracts in the United States for the period 2010-2015.
